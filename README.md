Flood
========

Flood is a Garry's Mod gamemode that allows players to engineer their own boat and put it to the test. Discover the difficulty and fun involved of building a boat, using it to stay afloat when the map floods, and battle other player's to get a victory!

This project is currently in development. Installation instructions will be up as soon as the project is at a playable state.
